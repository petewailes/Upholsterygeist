# Upholsterygeist

Upholsterygeist is a minimalist [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) theme built using [OpenDAWS](https://github.com/Builtvisible/opendaws). T&C runs a modified version of it known as Minigeist, so here's a [demo](https://toughcompetent.com/) of something similar.

## Features

2. Unzip the files and rename the folder to 'Upholsterygeist'
4. Upload the folder to 'ghost/content/themes'
5. Restart ghost and log in
